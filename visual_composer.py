    """
    VisualComposer acts as the high-level graphics engine. It manages and orchestrates 
    complex operations such as transformations, effects, and the grouping of 
    graphical elements. This class is responsible for:

    - Coordinating transformations like scaling, rotating, and translating graphical elements.
    - Applying visual effects and managing overall aesthetic properties of the scene.
    - Grouping low-level elements (handled by BasicRenderer) into higher-order structures.
    - Overseeing the composition of scenes, ensuring elements are combined and displayed coherently.
    - Acting as an interface between the low-level rendering engine and higher-level application logic.
    - Handling user inputs and events that affect the graphical composition.
